8. DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT.

Content providers are using the Microsoft digital rights management technology
for Windows Media distributed with this software ("WM-DRM") to protect the 
integrity of their content ("Secure Content") so that their intellectual property, 
including copyright, in such content is not misappropriated.  Portions of this 
software and other 3rd party applications use WM-DRM to play Secure Content 
("WM-DRM Software"). If the WM-DRM Software's security has been compromised, 
owners of Secure Content ("Secure Content Owners") may request that Microsoft 
revoke the WM-DRM Software's right to copy, display and/or play Secure Content. 
Revocation does not alter the WM-DRM Software's ability to play unprotected 
content. A list of revoked WM-DRM Software is sent to your computer whenever 
you download a license for Secure Content from the Internet.  Microsoft may, 
in conjunction with such license, also download revocation lists onto your 
computer on behalf of Secure Content Owners. Secure Content Owners may also 
require you to upgrade some of the WM-DRM components distributed with this 
software ("WM-DRM Upgrades") before accessing their content. When you attempt 
to play such content, WM-DRM Software built by Microsoft will notify you that 
a WM-DRM Upgrade is required and then ask for your consent before the WM-DRM 
Upgrade is downloaded. Non-Microsoft WM-DRM Software may do the same. If you 
decline the upgrade, you will not be able to access content that requires the 
WM-DRM Upgrade; however, you will still be able to access unprotected content 
and Secure Content that does not require the upgrade. WM-DRM features that 
access the Internet, such as acquiring new licenses and/or performing a required 
WM-DRM Upgrade, can be switched off. When these features are switched off, 
you will still be able to play Secure Content if you have a valid license for 
such content already stored on your computer.

9. DISTRIBUTION.  

You are hereby not licensed to make copies of the SOFTWARE as you wish without involving Jackson Siro; 
once he is aware you can give exact copies of the original SOFTWARE to anyone; you may also distribute the
SOFTWARE in its unmodified form via electronic means (Internet, BBS's, Shareware
distribution libraries, CD-ROMs, etc.). You may charge a distribution fee for
the package, but you must not represent in any way that you are selling the
SOFTWARE itself. Your distribution of the SOFTWARE will not entitle you to any
compensation from Jackson Siro. You must distribute a copy of this EULA with any copy 
of the SOFTWARE and anyone to whom you distribute the SOFTWARE is subject to 
this EULA.

10. TERMINATION. 

This Agreement and the license granted hereunder will terminate automatically 
if you fail to comply with the limitations described herein. 
Upon termination, you must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and documentation.

11. RESERVED RIGHTS.

All rights not expressly granted here are reserved to Jackson Siro and/or the respective 
authors (listed either in the documentation or within the SOFTWARE).
Jackson Siro reserves the right to make exceptions to any of these conditions, or alter 
these conditions, at any time. However, you may always use these conditions 
instead of any altered version if you prefer (note that this licence explicitly 
applies only to one version of the program; therefore, if Jackson Siro makes new
conditions in connection with a future version, you do not then have the right 
to apply these conditions to that version instead).

12. MISCELLANEOUS.
